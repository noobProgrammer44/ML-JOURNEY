This project aims to develop a small Neural Network that predicts the edibility of roasted coffee beans. The model will utilize tools such as Tensorflow and Keras for designing and training.

The project will focus on two key parameters: temperature in Celsius and duration in minutes. The optimal roasting duration is typically between 12 and 15 minutes, while the temperature should range from 175 to 260 degrees Celsius. As the temperature increases, the duration should decrease accordingly.

By training the Neural Network with this data, we aim to create a predictive model that can accurately determine whether a roasted coffee bean is still edible or has been burnt. The model's ability to analyze the temperature and duration inputs will enable it to provide valuable insights into the roasting process, ensuring the production of high-quality coffee beans.
